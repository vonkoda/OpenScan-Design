The standard Turntables (various shaft lengths) are circular, not D-Shaped like nearly all stepper motor shafts. This means they can (and do) spin around the stepper motor shaft when they meet any friction.
These versions correct that but keep the same overall length. They have thinner shaft bodies (under turntable) to further make it less likely to rub on the rotor during movements.
